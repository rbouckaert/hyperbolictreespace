# hyperbolictreespace
BEAST 2 package for exploring hyperbolic tree space

Requires [BEAST2](https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/) and [BEASTLabs](https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/BEASTLabs/) to compile.
Make sure to include [Apache commons math library](https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/lib/commons-math3-3.1.1.jar) in class path.


[PoincarreDiscTreeViewer](https://github.com/rbouckaert/hyperbolictreespace/blob/master/src/hyperbolictreespace/PoincarreDiscTreeViewer.java) visualises 4 points on a Poincarre disc and the associated tree.

[Trees2PoincarreDisk](https://github.com/rbouckaert/hyperbolictreespace/blob/master/src/hyperbolictreespace/Trees2PoincarreDisk.java) visualises sets of trees on a Poincarre disc.
